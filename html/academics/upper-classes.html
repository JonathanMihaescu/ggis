					<p>The Secondary consists of middle school and high school classes that aim to prepare students for college and

						their life. With a heavy emphasis on critical thinking and application of what they’ve learned, students are 
						encouraged to grew into leaders and doers in their class and community.</p>
					<p>The middle school grades mark a “transition to independence,” for the students. As they change classrooms each 
						period, students are expected to be organized, disciplined, and prepared for each class they attend. The core 
						classes during these years are: Math, English, History, and Science, but the students also have elective classes 
						that consist of: Music, Physical Education, Shop, IT, Art, Personal Finance, and a “Masterclass,” that allows them 
						to perform a “deep dive” into subjects that interest them. All of these classes are taught with the goal to provide
						the students with a mastery learning level of the subjects. These years are crucial to the physical, spiritual, 
						and academic development of the student as they grow into young adults. </p>
					<p>During high school, the students continue with the core classes of: Math, English, History, and Science as well 
						as Worldview Bible class every year that they attend our school. They have opportunities through their elective 
						classes, such as: Music class and Band, Physical Education and Health, IT Classes and Programming, Foreign Languages,
						 Shop and Construction classes, as well as SAT and college prep classes, MLA/APA writing classes, Vocabulary, 
						 and Leadership and Entrepreneurship classes. The high school students have the opportunity to gain practical 
						 experience through our Volunteer Program and Internship opportunities that arise through the Entrepreneurship 
						 and Masterclass. There are field trips and class trips planned during the year that allow the students to
						 experience learning outside the classroom, outside the city, and even outside the country. </p>
